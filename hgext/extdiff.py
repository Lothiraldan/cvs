The `extdiff' Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs
to compare revisions, or revision with working dir.  The external diff
programs are called with a configurable set of options and two
non-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of
files to compare.

To enable this extension:

  [extensions]
  hgext.extdiff =

The `extdiff' extension also allows to configure new diff commands, so
you do not need to type "hg extdiff -p kdiff3" always.

  [extdiff]
  # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
  cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
  ## or the old way:
  #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
  #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

  # add new command called vdiff, runs kdiff3
  vdiff = kdiff3

  # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice)
  meld =

  # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
  #(see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102)
  # Non english user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
  # your .vimrc
  vimdiff = gvim -f '+next' '+execute "DirDiff" argv(0) argv(1)'

You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal
"hg diff" command.  The `extdiff' extension makes snapshots of only
needed files, so running the external diff program will actually be
pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).
