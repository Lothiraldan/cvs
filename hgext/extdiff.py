#
# The `extdiff' Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs
# to compare revisions, or revision with working dir.  The external diff
# programs are called with a configurable set of options and two
# non-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of
# files to compare.
#
# To enable this extension:
#
#   [extensions]
#   hgext.extdiff =
#
# The `extdiff' extension also allows to configure new diff commands, so
# you do not need to type "hg extdiff -p kdiff3" always.
#
#   [extdiff]
#   # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
#   cmd.cdiff = gdiff
#   opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

#   # add new command called vdiff, runs kdiff3
#   cmd.vdiff = kdiff3

#   # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice)
#   cmd.meld =

#   # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
#   #(see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102)
#   # Non english user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
#   # your .vimrc
#   cmd.vimdiff = gvim
#   opts.vimdiff = -f '+next' '+execute "DirDiff" argv(0) argv(1)'
#
# Each custom diff commands can have two parts: a `cmd' and an `opts'
# part.  The cmd.xxx option defines the name of an executable program
# that will be run, and opts.xxx defines a set of command-line options
# which will be inserted to the command between the program name and
# the files/directories to diff (i.e. the cdiff example above).
#
# You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal
# "hg diff" command.  The `extdiff' extension makes snapshots of only
# needed files, so running the external diff program will actually be
# pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).
