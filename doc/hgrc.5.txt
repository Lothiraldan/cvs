NAME
----
hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial

SYNOPSIS
--------

The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behaviour.

FILES
-----

Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is
installed.

(Unix)    <install-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc::
(Unix)    <install-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc::
    Per-installation configuration files, searched for in the
    directory where Mercurial is installed.  For example, if installed
    in /shared/tools, Mercurial will look in
    /shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc.  Options in these files apply to
    all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.

(Unix)    /etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc::
(Unix)    /etc/mercurial/hgrc::
(Windows) C:\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini::
    Per-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial
    is running.  Options in these files apply to all Mercurial
    commands executed by any user in any directory.  Options in these
    files override per-installation options.

(Unix)    $HOME/.hgrc::
(Windows) C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Mercurial.ini
    Per-user configuration file, for the user running Mercurial.
    Options in this file apply to all Mercurial commands executed by
    any user in any directory.  Options in this file override
    per-installation and per-system options.

(Unix, Windows) <repo>/.hg/hgrc::
    Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
    particular repository.  This file is not version-controlled, and
    will not get transferred during a "clone" operation.  Options in
    this file override options in all other configuration files.

SYNTAX
------

A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header
and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted.

    [spam]
    eggs=ham
    green=
       eggs

Each line contains one entry.  If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry.

Leading whitespace is removed from values.  Empty lines are skipped.

The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other
values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.

Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
comments.

SECTIONS
--------

This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible
keys, and their possible values.

decode/encode::
  Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
  typically be used for newline processing or other
  localization/canonicalization of files.

  Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
  Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
  root.  For example, to match any file ending in ".txt" in the root
  directory only, use the pattern "*.txt".  To match any file ending
  in ".c" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**.c".

  The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or
  "tempfile:".  If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default.

  A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the
  transformed data on stdout.

  Pipe example:

    [encode]
    # uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
    # note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
    *.gz = pipe: gunzip

    [decode]
    # recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
    # can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
    *.gz = gzip

  A "tempfile:" command is a template.  The string INFILE is replaced
  with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
  filtered by the command.  The string OUTFILE is replaced with the
  name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be
  written by the command.

  NOTE: the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
  where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
  strange effects.  In particular, if you are doing line ending
  conversion on Windows using the popular dos2unix and unix2dos
  programs, you *must* use the tempfile mechanism, as using pipes will
  corrupt the contents of your files.

  Tempfile example:

    [encode]
    # convert files to unix line ending conventions on checkin
    **.txt = tempfile: dos2unix -n INFILE OUTFILE

    [decode]
    # convert files to windows line ending conventions when writing
    # them to the working dir
    **.txt = tempfile: unix2dos -n INFILE OUTFILE

hooks::
  Commands that get automatically executed by various actions such as
  starting or finishing a commit. Multiple commands can be run for
  the same action by appending a suffix to the action. Overriding a
  site-wide hook can be done by changing its value or setting it to
  an empty string.

  Example .hg/hgrc:

    [hooks]
    # do not use the site-wide hook
    incoming =
    incoming.email = /my/email/hook
    incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook

  Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give added
  useful information.  For each hook below, the environment variables
  it is passed are listed with names of the form "$HG_foo".

  changegroup;;
    Run after a changegroup has been added via push or pull. ID of the
    first new changeset is in $HG_NODE.
  commit;;
    Run after a changeset has been created in the local repository.
    ID of the newly created changeset is in $HG_NODE.  Parent
    changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
  incoming;;
    Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or unbundled into
    the local repository.  The ID of the newly arrived changeset is in
    $HG_NODE.
  precommit;;
    Run before starting a local commit.  Exit status 0 allows the
    commit to proceed.  Non-zero status will cause the commit to fail.
    Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
  pretag;;
    Run before creating a tag.  Exit status 0 allows the tag to be
    created.  Non-zero status will cause the tag to fail.  ID of
    changeset to tag is in $HG_NODE.  Name of tag is in $HG_TAG.  Tag
    is local if $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0.
  pretxncommit;;
    Run after a changeset has been created but the transaction not yet
    committed.  Changeset is visible to hook program.  This lets you
    validate commit message and changes.  Exit status 0 allows the
    commit to proceed.  Non-zero status will cause the transaction to
    be rolled back.  ID of changeset is in $HG_NODE.  Parent changeset
    IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
  tag;;
    Run after a tag is created.  ID of tagged changeset is in
    $HG_NODE.  Name of tag is in $HG_TAG.  Tag is local if
    $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0.

  In earlier releases, the names of hook environment variables did not
  have a "HG_" prefix.  These unprefixed names are still provided in
  the environment for backwards compatibility, but their use is
  deprecated, and they will be removed in a future release.

  proxy.
