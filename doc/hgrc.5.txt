NAME
----
hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial

SYNOPSIS
--------

The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behaviour.

FILES
-----

Mercurial reads configuration data from two files:

$HOME/.hgrc::
    Global configuration options that apply to all Mercurial commands,
    no matter where they are run.

<repo>/.hg/hgrc::
    Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
    particular repository.  This file is not version-controlled, and
    will not get transferred during a "clone" operation.  Values in
    this file override global values.

SYNTAX
------

A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header
and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted.

    [spam]
    eggs=ham
    green=
       eggs

Each line contains one entry.  If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry.

Leading whitespace is removed from values.  Empty lines are skipped.

The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other
values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.

Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
comments.

SECTIONS
--------

This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible
keys, and their possible values.

hooks::
  Commands that get automatically executed by various actions such as
  starting or finishing a commit.
  precommit;;
    Run before starting a commit.  Exit status 0 allows the commit to
    proceed.  Non-zero status will cause the commit to fail.
  commit;;
    Run after a changeset has been created. Passed the ID of the newly
    created changeset.

http_proxy::
  Used to access web-based Mercurial repositories through a HTTP
  proxy.
  host;;
    Host name and (optional) port of the proxy server, for example
    "myproxy:8000".
  user;;
    Optional.  User name to authenticate with at the proxy server.
  passwd;;
    Optional.  Password to authenticate with at the proxy server.
  no;;
    Optional.  Comma-separated list of host names that should bypass
    the proxy.

paths::
  Assigns symbolic names to repositories.  The left side is the
  symbolic name, and the right gives the directory or URL that is the
  location of the repository.

tags::
  Tags that are local to a repository and not distributed or version
  controlled.  The left side is the tag name, and the right is the
  ID of the changeset to identify.
