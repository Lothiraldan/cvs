NAME
----
hg - Mercurial source code management system

SYNOPSIS
--------
'hg' [global option]... <command> [command/global option]... [argument]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The hg(1) command provides a command line interface to the Mercurial system.

COMMAND ELEMENTS
----------------

files ...::
    indicates one or more filename or relative path filenames; see
    "FILE NAME PATTERNS" for information on pattern matching

path::
    indicates a path on the local machine

revision::
    indicates a changeset which can be specified as a changeset revision
    number, a tag, or a unique substring of the changeset hash value

repository path::
    either the pathname of a local repository or the URI of a remote
    repository. There are two available URI protocols, http:// which is
    fast and the static-http:// protocol which is much slower but does not
    require a special server on the web host.

FILES
-----
 .hgignore::
    This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that describe file
    names that should be ignored by hg. For details, see hgignore(5).

 .hgtags::
    This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one of each
    separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of the repository
    contents.

 /etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc::
    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in .hg/hgrc
    override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override settings made in the
    global /etc/mercurial/hgrc configuration. See hgrc(5) for details of
    the contents and format of these files.

Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in .orig, if
the .orig file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial, it
will be overwritten.

BUGS
----
Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (See Resources below)
when you find them.
