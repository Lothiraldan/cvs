# TODO there are a few deficiencies in this file:
# * Due to the way the file is loaded, references to other entities in the
#   template doesn't work. That requires us to inline.
# * The "namespace" of the labels needs to be worked out. We currently
#   piggyback on existing values so color works.
# * Obsolescence isn't considered for node labels. See _cset_labels in
#   map-cmdline.default.
