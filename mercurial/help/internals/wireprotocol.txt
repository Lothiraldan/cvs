The Mercurial wire protocol is a request-response based protocol
with multiple wire representations.

Each request is modeled as a command name, a dictionary of arguments, and
optional raw input. Command arguments and their types are intrinsic
properties of commands. So is the response type of the command. This means
clients can't always send arbitrary arguments to servers and servers can't
return multiple response types.

The protocol is synchronous and does not support multiplexing (concurrent
commands).
