    The successors set of a changeset A are the group of revisions that succeed
    A. It succeeds A as a consistent whole, each revision being only a partial
    replacement. The successors set contains non-obsolete changesets only.

    This function returns the full list of successor sets which is why it
    returns a list of tuples and not just a single tuple. Each tuple is a valid
    successors set. Note that (A,) may be a valid successors set for changeset A
    (see below).

    In most cases, a changeset A will have a single element (e.g. the changeset
    A is replaced by A') in its successors set. Though, it is also common for a
    changeset A to have no elements in its successor set (e.g. the changeset
    has been pruned). Therefore, the returned list of successors sets will be
    [(A',)] or [], respectively.

    When a changeset A is split into A' and B', however, it will result in a
    successors set containing more than a single element, i.e. [(A',B')].
    Divergent changesets will result in multiple successors sets, i.e. [(A',),
    (A'')].

    If a changeset A is not obsolete, then it will conceptually have no
    successors set. To distinguish this from a pruned changeset, the successor
    set will contain itself only, i.e. [(A,)].

    Finally, successors unknown locally are considered to be pruned (obsoleted
    without any successors).

    The optional `cache` parameter is a dictionary that may contain precomputed
    successors sets. It is meant to reuse the computation of a previous call to
    `successorssets` when multiple calls are made at the same time. The cache
    dictionary is updated in place. The caller is responsible for its life
    span. Code that makes multiple calls to `successorssets` *must* use this
    cache mechanism or suffer terrible performance.
