# Tags computation can be expensive and caches exist to make it fast in
# the common case.
#
# The "hgtagsfnodes1" cache file caches the .hgtags filenode values for
# each revision in the repository. The file is effectively an array of
# fixed length records. Read the docs for "hgtagsfnodescache" for technical
# details.
#
# The .hgtags filenode cache grows in proportion to the length of the
# changelog. The file is truncated when the # changelog is stripped.
#
# The purpose of the filenode cache is to avoid the most expensive part
# of finding global tags, which is looking up the .hgtags filenode in the
# manifest for each head. This can take dozens or over 100ms for
# repositories with very large manifests. Multiplied by dozens or even
# hundreds of heads and there is a significant performance concern.
#
# There also exist a separate cache file for each repository filter.
# These "tags-*" files store information about the history of tags.
#
# The tags cache files consists of a cache validation line followed by
# a history of tags.
#
# The cache validation line has the format:
#
#   <tiprev> <tipnode> [<filteredhash>]
#
# <tiprev> is an integer revision and <tipnode> is a 40 character hex
# node for that changeset. These redundantly identify the repository
# tip from the time the cache was written. In addition, <filteredhash>,
# if present, is a 40 character hex hash of the contents of the filtered
# revisions for this filter. If the set of filtered revs changes, the
# hash will change and invalidate the cache.
#
# The history part of the tags cache consists of lines of the form:
#
#   <node> <tag>
#
# (This format is identical to that of .hgtags files.)
#
# <tag> is the tag name and <node> is the 40 character hex changeset
# the tag is associated with.
#
# Tags are written sorted by tag name.
#
# Tags associated with multiple changesets have an entry for each changeset.
# The most recent changeset (in terms of revlog ordering for the head
# setting it) for each tag is last.
