# Tags computation can be expensive and caches exist to make it fast in
# the common case.
#
# The "hgtagsfnodes1" cache file caches the .hgtags filenode values for
# each revision in the repository. The file is effectively an array of
# fixed length records. Read the docs for "hgtagsfnodescache" for technical
# details.
#
# The .hgtags filenode cache grows in proportion to the length of the
# changelog. The file is truncated when the # changelog is stripped.
#
# The purpose of the filenode cache is to avoid the most expensive part
# of finding global tags, which is looking up the .hgtags filenode in the
# manifest for each head. This can take dozens or over 100ms for
# repositories with very large manifests. Multiplied by dozens or even
# hundreds of heads and there is a significant performance concern.
#
# The "tags" cache stores information about heads and the history of tags.
#
# The cache file consists of two parts. The first part maps head nodes
# to .hgtags filenodes. The second part is a history of tags. The two
# parts are separated by an empty line.
#
# The filenodes part of "tags" has effectively been superseded by
# "hgtagsfnodes1." It is being kept around for backwards compatbility.
#
# The first part consists of lines of the form:
#
#   <headrev> <headnode> [<hgtagsnode>]
#
# <headrev> is an integer revision and <headnode> is a 40 character hex
# node for that changeset. These redundantly identify a repository
# head from the time the cache was written.
#
# <tagnode> is the filenode of .hgtags on that head. Heads with no .hgtags
# file will have no <hgtagsnode> (just 2 values per line).
#
# The filenode cache is ordered from tip to oldest (which is part of why
# <headrev> is there: a quick check of the tip from when the cache was
# written against the current tip is all that is needed to check whether
# the cache is up to date).
#
# The second part of the tags cache consists of lines of the form:
#
#   <node> <tag>
#
# (This format is identical to that of .hgtags files.)
#
# <tag> is the tag name and <node> is the 40 character hex changeset
# the tag is associated with.
#
# Tags are written sorted by tag name.
#
# Tags associated with multiple changesets have an entry for each changeset.
# The most recent changeset (in terms of revlog ordering for the head
# setting it) for each tag is last.
