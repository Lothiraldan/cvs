        When the source code is converted to a code object, we transform
        certain patterns to be Python 3 compatible. This allows us to write code
        that is natively Python 2 and compatible with Python 3 without
        making the code excessively ugly.

        We do this by transforming the token stream between parse and compile.

        Implementing transformations invalidates caching assumptions made
        by the built-in importer. The built-in importer stores a header on
        saved bytecode files indicating the Python/bytecode version. If the
        version changes, the cached bytecode is ignored. The Mercurial
        transformations could change at any time. This means we need to check
        that cached bytecode was generated with the current transformation
        code or there could be a mismatch between cached bytecode and what
        would be generated from this class.

        We supplement the bytecode caching layer by wrapping ``get_data``
        and ``set_data``. These functions are called when the
        ``SourceFileLoader`` retrieves and saves bytecode cache files,
        respectively. We simply add an additional header on the file. As
        long as the version in this file is changed when semantics change,
        cached bytecode should be invalidated when transformations change.

        The added header has the form ``HG<VERSION>``. That is a literal
