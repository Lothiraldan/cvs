"""Handling of the new bundle2 format

The goal of bundle2 is to act as an atomically packet to transmit a set of
payloads in an application agnostic way. It consist in a sequence of "parts"
that will be handed to and processed by the application layer.


General format architecture
===========================

The format is architectured as follow

 - magic string
 - stream level parameters
 - payload parts (any number)
 - end of stream marker.

The current implementation accept some stream level option but no part.

Details on the Binary format
============================

All numbers are unsigned and big endian.

stream level parameters
------------------------

Binary format is as follow

:params size: (16 bits integer)

  The total number of Bytes used by the parameters

:params value: arbitrary number of Bytes

  A blob of `params size` containing the serialized version of all stream level
  parameters.

  The blob contains a space separated list of parameters.

  Parameter value are not supported yet.

  Special character in param name are not supported yet.




Payload part
------------------------

Binary format is as follow

:header size: (16 bits inter)

  The total number of Bytes used by the part headers. When the header is empty
  (size = 0) this is interpreted as the end of stream marker.

  Currently forced to 0 in the current state of the implementation
