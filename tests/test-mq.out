mq extension - patch management and development

This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all known patches, and
applied patches (subset of known patches).

Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

Common tasks (use "hg help command" for more details):

prepare repository to work with patches   qinit
create new patch                          qnew
import existing patch                     qimport

print patch series                        qseries
print applied patches                     qapplied
print name of top applied patch           qtop

add known patch to applied stack          qpush
remove patch from applied stack           qpop
refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

list of commands:

 qapplied     print the patches already applied
 qclone       clone main and patch repository at same time
 qcommit      commit changes in the queue repository
 qdelete      remove patches from queue
 qdiff        diff of the current patch and subsequent modifications
 qfinish      move applied patches into repository history
 qfold        fold the named patches into the current patch
 qgoto        push or pop patches until named patch is at top of stack
 qguard       set or print guards for a patch
 qheader      print the header of the topmost or specified patch
 qimport      import a patch
 qinit        init a new queue repository
 qnew         create a new patch
 qnext        print the name of the next patch
 qpop         pop the current patch off the stack
 qprev        print the name of the previous patch
 qpush        push the next patch onto the stack
 qrefresh     update the current patch
 qrename      rename a patch
 qrestore     restore the queue state saved by a rev
 qsave        save current queue state
 qselect      set or print guarded patches to push
 qseries      print the entire series file
 qtop         print the name of the current patch
 qunapplied   print the patches not yet applied
 strip        strip a revision and all its descendants from the repository
