mq extension - manage a stack of patches

This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all known patches, and applied
patches (subset of known patches).

Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches directory.
Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

Common tasks (use "hg help command" for more details):

  create new patch                          qnew
  import existing patch                     qimport

  print patch series                        qseries
  print applied patches                     qapplied

  add known patch to applied stack          qpush
  remove patch from applied stack           qpop
  refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to avoid
losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty files creations
or deletions. This behaviour can be configured with:

  [mq]
  git = auto/keep/yes/no

If set to 'keep', mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while
preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to 'yes' or 'no', mq
will override the [diff] section and always generate git or regular patches,
possibly losing data in the second case.

You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches". You can create
other, independent patch queues with the "hg qqueue" command.

list of commands:

 qapplied     print the patches already applied
 qclone       clone main and patch repository at same time
 qdelete      remove patches from queue
 qdiff        diff of the current patch and subsequent modifications
 qfinish      move applied patches into repository history
 qfold        fold the named patches into the current patch
 qgoto        push or pop patches until named patch is at top of stack
 qguard       set or print guards for a patch
 qheader      print the header of the topmost or specified patch
 qimport      import a patch
 qnew         create a new patch
 qnext        print the name of the next patch
 qpop         pop the current patch off the stack
 qprev        print the name of the previous patch
 qpush        push the next patch onto the stack
 qqueue       manage multiple patch queues
 qrefresh     update the current patch
 qrename      rename a patch
 qselect      set or print guarded patches to push
 qseries      print the entire series file
 qtop         print the name of the current patch
 qunapplied   print the patches not yet applied
 strip        strip a changeset and all its descendants from the repository
