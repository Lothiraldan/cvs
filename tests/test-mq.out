mq extension - patch management and development

This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository.  It manages two stacks of patches - all known patches, and
applied patches (subset of known patches).

Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
directory.  Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

Common tasks (use "hg help command" for more details):

prepare repository to work with patches   qinit
create new patch                          qnew
import existing patch                     qimport

print patch series                        qseries
print applied patches                     qapplied
print name of top applied patch           qtop

add known patch to applied stack          qpush
remove patch from applied stack           qpop
refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

list of commands (use "hg help -v mq" to show aliases and global options):
