% These will fail (using --source)
% E onto D - rebase onto an ancestor
abort: source is descendant of destination
% D onto E - rebase onto a descendant
abort: source is ancestor of destination
% E onto B - merge revision with both parents not in ancestors of target
abort: cannot use revision 4 as base, result would have 3 parents

% These will abort gracefully (using --base)
% E onto E - rebase onto same changeset
nothing to rebase
% E onto D - rebase onto an ancestor
