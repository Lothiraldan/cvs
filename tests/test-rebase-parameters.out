move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch

    Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of
    history onto another. This can be useful for linearizing local
    changes relative to a master development tree.

    If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a merge, it can be
    continued with --continue/-c or aborted with --abort/-a.

options:

 -s --source        rebase from a given revision
 -b --base          rebase from the base of a given revision
 -d --dest          rebase onto a given revision
    --collapse      collapse the rebased changesets
    --keep          keep original changesets
    --keepbranches  keep original branch names
 -c --continue      continue an interrupted rebase
 -a --abort         abort an interrupted rebase
    --style         display using template map file
    --template      display with template
