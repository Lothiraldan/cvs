Set up SMTP server:

  $ CERTSDIR="$TESTDIR/sslcerts"
  $ cat "$CERTSDIR/priv.pem" "$CERTSDIR/pub.pem" >> server.pem

  $ python "$TESTDIR/dummysmtpd.py" -p $HGPORT --pid-file a.pid -d \
  > --tls smtps --certificate `pwd`/server.pem
  listening at localhost:$HGPORT
  $ cat a.pid >> $DAEMON_PIDS

Ensure hg email output is sent to stdout:

  $ unset PAGER

Set up repository:

  $ hg init t
  $ cd t
  $ cat <<EOF >> .hg/hgrc
  > [extensions]
  > patchbomb =
  > [email]
  > method = smtp
  > [smtp]
  > host = localhost
  > port = $HGPORT
  > tls = smtps
  > EOF

  $ echo a > a
  $ hg commit -Ama -d '1 0'
