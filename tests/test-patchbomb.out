send changesets by email

    By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by hg export,
    one per message.  The series starts with a "[PATCH 0 of N]"
    introduction, which describes the series as a whole.

    Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using
    the first line of the changeset description as the subject text.
    The message contains two or three body parts.  First, the rest of
    the changeset description.  Next, (optionally) if the diffstat
    program is installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch.
    Finally, the patch itself, as generated by "hg export".

    With --outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not
    found in the destination repository (or only those which are
    ancestors of the specified revisions if any are provided)

    With --bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing,
    but a single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an
    attachment will be sent.

    Examples:

    hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
    hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
    hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
    hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

    hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
    hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
    hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
    hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

    hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
    hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
    hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
    hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

    Before using this command, you will need to enable email in your hgrc.
    See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.
