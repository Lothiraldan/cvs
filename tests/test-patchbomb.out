send changesets as a series of patch emails

    The series starts with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction, which
    describes the series as a whole.

    Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using
    the first line of the changeset description as the subject text.
    The message contains two or three body parts.  First, the rest of
    the changeset description.  Next, (optionally) if the diffstat
    program is installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch.
    Finally, the patch itself, as generated by "hg export".

options:

 -a --attach    send patches as inline attachments
    --bcc       email addresses of blind copy recipients
 -c --cc        email addresses of copy recipients
 -d --diffstat  add diffstat output to messages
 -g --git       use git extended diff format
 -f --from      email address of sender
    --plain     omit hg patch header
 -n --test      print messages that would be sent
 -m --mbox      write messages to mbox file instead of sending them
 -s --subject   subject of first message (intro or single patch)
 -t --to        email addresses of recipients
