notify extension - hooks for sending email notifications at commit/push time

Subscriptions can be managed through a hgrc file. Default mode is to print
messages to stdout, for testing and configuring.

To use, configure the notify extension and enable it in hgrc like this:

  [extensions]
  notify =

  [hooks]
  # one email for each incoming changeset
  incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
  # batch emails when many changesets incoming at one time
  changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

  [notify]
  # config items go here

Required configuration items:

  config = /path/to/file # file containing subscriptions

Optional configuration items:

  test = True            # print messages to stdout for testing
  strip = 3              # number of slashes to strip for url paths
  domain = example.com   # domain to use if committer missing domain
  style = ...            # style file to use when formatting email
  template = ...         # template to use when formatting email
  incoming = ...         # template to use when run as incoming hook
  changegroup = ...      # template when run as changegroup hook
  maxdiff = 300          # max lines of diffs to include (0=none, -1=all)
  maxsubject = 67        # truncate subject line longer than this
  diffstat = True        # add a diffstat before the diff content
  sources = serve        # notify if source of incoming changes in this list
                         # (serve == ssh or http, push, pull, bundle)
  merge = False          # send notification for merges (default True)
  [email]
  from = user@host.com   # email address to send as if none given
  [web]
  baseurl = http://hgserver/... # root of hg web site for browsing commits

The notify config file has same format as a regular hgrc file. It has two
sections so you can express subscriptions in whatever way is handier for you.

  [usersubs]
  # key is subscriber email, value is ","-separated list of glob patterns
  user@host = pattern

  [reposubs]
  # key is glob pattern, value is ","-separated list of subscriber emails
  pattern = user@host

Glob patterns are matched against path to repository root.

If you like, you can put notify config file in repository that users can push
changes to, they can manage their own subscriptions.
