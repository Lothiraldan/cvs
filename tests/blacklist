# ConfigParser format
# Definitions of blacklists for run-tests.py
#
# Identify in config sections a list of tests you want to be skipped.
# Section names are meant to be used as targets for run-tests.py --blacklist
# option.
# "test-" prefixes should be omitted from test names. Values are not used.
#
# e.g. if your file looks like:
## [example]
## hgrc =
## help = "this string is not used"
# then calling "run-tests.py --blacklist example" will exclude test-hgrc and
# test-help from the list of tests to run.

# When --inotify is activated, help output and config changes:

# --inotify activates de facto the inotify extension. It does not play well
# with inotify-specific tests, which activate/desactivate inotify at will:
