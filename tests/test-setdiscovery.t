Function to test discovery between two repos in both directions, using both the local shortcut
(which is currently not activated by default) and the full remotable protocol:

  $ testdesc() { # revs_a, revs_b, dagdesc
  >     if [ -d foo ]; then rm -rf foo; fi
  >     hg init foo
  >     cd foo
  >     hg debugbuilddag "$3"
  >     hg clone . a $1 --quiet
  >     hg clone . b $2 --quiet
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- a -> b tree"
  >     hg -R a debugdiscovery b --verbose --old
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- a -> b set"
  >     hg -R a debugdiscovery b --verbose --debug
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- b -> a tree"
  >     hg -R b debugdiscovery a --verbose --old
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- b -> a set"
  >     hg -R b debugdiscovery a --verbose --debug
  >     cd ..
