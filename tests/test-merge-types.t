Update to link without local change should get us a symlink (issue3316):

  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg up
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg st

Update to link with local change should cause a merge prompt (issue3200):

Test merge with no common ancestor:
a: just different
b: x vs -, different (cannot calculate x, cannot ask merge tool)
c: x vs -, same (cannot calculate x, merge tool is no good)
d: x vs l, different
e: x vs l, same
f: - vs l, different
g: - vs l, same
h: l vs l, different
(where same means the filelog entry is shared and there thus is an ancestor!)
