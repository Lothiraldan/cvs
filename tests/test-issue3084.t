Whatever ... commit something so we can invoke merge when updating

  $ hg commit -m '3: Merge'

Updating from largefile to normal - no reason to prompt

  $ hg up -r 2
  getting changed largefiles
  0 largefiles updated, 0 removed
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 1 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ cat foo
  normal

(the update above used to leave the working dir in a very weird state - clean it
  $ hg up -qr null
  $ hg up -qr 2
)

Updating from normal to largefile - no reason to prompt

  $ hg up -r 3

Systematic testing of merges involving largefiles:

Ancestor: normal  Parent: normal-id  Parent: large   result: large
Ancestor: normal  Parent: normal2    Parent: large   result: ?
Ancestor: large   Parent: large-id   Parent: normal  result: normal
Ancestor: large   Parent: large2     Parent: normal  result: ?

All cases should try merging both ways.

Prepare test repo:

  $ hg init merges
  $ cd merges

prepare cases with "normal" ancestor:

  $ hg up -qr null
  $ echo normal > f
  $ hg ci -Aqm "normal-ancestor"
  $ hg tag -l "normal-ancestor"
  $ touch f2
  $ hg ci -Aqm "normal-id"
  $ hg tag -l "normal-id"
  $ echo normal2 > f
  $ hg ci -m "normal2"
  $ hg tag -l "normal2"
  $ echo normal > f
  $ hg ci -Aqm "normal-same"
  $ hg tag -l "normal-same"
  $ hg up -qr "normal-ancestor"
  $ hg rm f
  $ echo large > f
  $ hg add --large f
  $ hg ci -qm "large"
  $ hg tag -l "large"

prepare cases with "large" ancestor:

  $ hg up -qr null

  $ hg add --large f
  $ hg ci -qm "large-ancestor"
