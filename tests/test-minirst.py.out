paragraphs formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is some text in the first paragraph.

  An indented paragraph with just two lines.

The third paragraph. It is followed by some random lines
with spurious spaces.

No indention here, despite the uneven left margin.

  Only the left-most line (this line!) is significant for
  the indentation

paragraphs formatted to fit within 30 characters:

definitions formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Term
  Definition. The indented lines make up the definition.
Another Term
    Another definition. The final line in the definition
    determines the indentation, so this will be indented
    with four spaces.
  A Nested/Indented Term
    Definition.

literals formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fully minimized form is the most convenient form:

  Hello
    literal
      world

In the partially minimized form a paragraph simply ends with
space-double-colon.

  ////////////////////////////////////////
  long un-wrapped line in a literal block
  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  This literal block is started with '::',
    the so-called expanded form. The paragraph
      with '::' disappears in the final output.

We can have indented lists:

  - This is an indented list item
  - Another indented list item:

      - A literal block in the middle
            of an indented list.

      (The above is not a list item since we are in the literal block.)

  Literal block with no indentation (apart from
  the two spaces added to all literal blocks).

options formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is support for simple option lists, but only with long
options:

--all      Output all.
--both     Output both (this description is quite long).
--long     Output all day long.
--par      This option has two paragraphs in its
           description. This is the first.

           This is the second.  Blank lines may be omitted
           between options (as above) or left in (as here).

The next paragraph looks like an option list, but lacks the
two-space marker after the option. It is treated as a normal
paragraph:

--foo bar baz
