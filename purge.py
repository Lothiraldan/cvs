    '''removes files not tracked by mercurial

    Delete files not known to mercurial, this is useful to test local and
    uncommitted changes in the otherwise clean source tree.

    This means that purge will delete:
     - Unknown files: files marked with "?" by "hg status"
     - Ignored files: files usually ignored by Mercurial because they match a
       pattern in a ".hgignore" file
     - Empty directories: infact Mercurial ignores directories unless they
       contain files under source control managment
    But it will leave untouched:
     - Unmodified tracked files
     - Modified tracked files
     - New files added to the repository (with "hg add")

    If names are given, only files matching the names are considered, else
    all files in the repository directory are considered.

    Be careful with purge, you could irreversibly delete some files you
    forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the list of
    files that this program would delete use the -vn options.
