General:
- Better documentation
- More regression tests
- More specific try/except.
- less code duplication, more code in the right places
- python 2.2 support
- export to git
- Code cleanup: apply http://python.org/peps/pep-0008.html

Core:
- difflib creating/removing files (fixed except dates: should be epoch)
- directory foo.d or foo.i with existing file foo (use some quoting?)
- get various options from hgrc (e.g. history always -v, tip always -q)
- hg over https:// and rsync://
- hooks for new changesets getting pulled/imported etc.
- make showing removed files (in history etc.) faster.
- hgmerge error: merge should abort nicely and running it again should work
- if hardlinking fails, pull should be used
- .hgignore should use new patterns

Commands:
- hg add <directory> should work (currently only: hg add -I <dir>)
- hg status <filename>: file rev, changeset rev, changed, added,
  deleted, sha-1
- select to pull a subset of the heads
- commands.py: number of args too much magic (e.g. in import_())
- optionally only show merges (two parents)
- automatic pull fallback to old-http://
- hg pull http://foo tries hostname
  'foo?cmd=changegroup&roots=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
- pass options to ssh (debug/verbose/remote hg command etc.)
- create a commented .hg/hgrc on init/clone
- hg pull default in a subdir doesn't work, if it is a relative path
- hg clone should store corrected relative paths, so moving a directory
  containing related repositories works again
- if everyone knows 'hg clone': hg init [DIR]
- if everyone knows 'hg update -m': remove -t

Web:
- optionally only show merges (two parents)
- one hgweb with many repos (another script)
- hgweb tip link too long (URL?cmd=changelog;rev=)
- hgweb: shorter links (e.g. cs=... instead of cmd=changeset;node=...?)
- hgweb: deliver static files (e.g. favicon, stylesheets)
- hgweb personalization: timezone (display/change), display of
  features, number of entries per page
- some web servers think hgweb.cgi.[di] is a CGI script with old-http://
  (use quoting (see foo.d in Core) or document server configurations?)
- link children in hgweb
- allow verbose mode
- hide trivial parent (like in show_changeset)
