Release Notes
-------------

2006-01-29  v0.8 

* Upgrade notes:

  - diff and status command are now repo-wide by default
   (use 'hg diff .' for the old behavior)
  - GPG signing is now done with the gpg extension
  - the --text option for commit, rawcommit, and tag has been removed
  - the copy/rename --parents option has been removed

* Major changes from 0.7 to 0.8:

  - faster status, diff, and commit
  - reduced memory usage for push and pull
  - improved extension API
  - new bisect, gpg, hgk, and win32text extensions
  - short URLs, binary file handling, and optional gitweb skin for hgweb
  - numerous new command options including log --keyword and pull --rev
  - improved hooks and file filtering

 
2005-09-21  v0.7 with modifications

* New INI files have been added to control Mercurial's behaviour:

    System-wide -  C:\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini
    Per-user    -  C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Mercurial.ini

  A default version of the system-wide INI file is installed with
  Mercurial.  No per-user INI file is installed, but it will be
  honoured if you create one.

* Windows line endings are now handled automatically and correctly by
  the update and commit commands.  See the INI file for how to
  customise this behaviour.

* NOTE: Much of the rest of the Mercurial code does not handle Windows
  line endings properly.  Accordingly, the output of the diff command,
  for example, will appear huge until I fix this.

* Packaged text files now have correct Windows line endings.


2005-09-21  v0.7 with modifications

* This is the first standalone release of Mercurial for Windows.

* I believe it to be mostly functional, with one exception: there is
  no support yet for DOS <-> Unix line ending conversion.
