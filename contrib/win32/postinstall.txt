Release Notes
-------------

2006-07-24  v0.9.1

Major changes between Mercurial 0.9 and 0.9.1:

 New features:
 - You can now configure your 'hgweb' server to let remote users
   'push' changes over http.
 - You can now 'import' a patch in a mail message by saving the mail
   message, and importing it.  This works for patches sent either
   inline or as attachments.
 - The 'diff' command now accepts '-rA:B' syntax as a synonym for
   '-r A -r B', and adds '-b' and '-B' options.

 New contributions and extensions:
 - The 'acl' extension lets you lock down parts of a repository
   against incoming changes
 - The 'extdiff' extension lets you run your favourite graphical
   change viewer
 - Comprehensive integration with the 'vim' editor
 - A restricted shell for 'ssh'-hosted repositories
 - An importer for 'darcs' repositories

 New hooks added:
 - 'preupdate' is run before an update or merge in the working
   directory.
 - 'update' is run after an update or merge in the working
   directory.

 Behaviour changes:
 - NOTE: Mercurial as installed by the Windows binary
   installer no longer performs automatic line-ending conversion for
   Unix/Linux compatibility.  To re-enable this feature, edit your
   'mercurial.ini' file after you upgrade.
 - The Windows binary installer now automatically adds 'hg' to your
   '%PATH%'.
 - The 'backout' command now runs an editor by default, to let you
   modify the commit message for a backed-out changeset.
 - An earlier problem with parsing of tags has been fixed.
   This makes tag parsing slower but more reliable.

 Memory usage and performance improvements:
 - The 'remove' command has been rewritten to be hundreds of times
   faster in large repositories.
 - It is now possible to 'clone' a repository very quickly over a
   LAN, if the server is configured to allow it.  See the new 'server'
   section in the 'hgrc' documentation.

 Other changes of note:
 - Mercurial will now print help for an extension if you type 'hg
   help EXT_NAME'.
 - The usual array of bug fixes and documentation improvements.
 - The integrated web server is now more WSGI-compliant.
 - Work has begun to solidify Mercurial's API for use by third-party
   packages.


2006-05-10  v0.9

* Major changes between Mercurial 0.8.1 and 0.9:

  - The repository file format has been improved.
    - This has resulted in an average 40% reduction in disk space    usage.
    - The new format (called RevlogNG) is now the default.
    - Mercurial works perfectly with both the old and new repository
      file formats. It can transfer changes transparently between
      repositories of either format.
    - To use the new repository format, simply use `hg clone --pull` to
      clone an existing repository.
    - Note: Versions 0.8.1 and earlier of Mercurial cannot read
      RevlogNG repositories directly, but they can `clone`, `pull`
      from, and `push` to servers that are serving RevlogNG
      repositories.
  - Memory usage has been improved by over 50% for many common operations.
  - Substantial performance improvements on large repositories.
  - New commands:
    - 'archive' - generate a directory tree snapshot, tarball, or zip
      file of a revision
  - Deprecated commands:
    - 'addremove' - replaced by 'add' and 'remove --after'
    - 'forget' - replaced by 'revert'
    - 'undo' - replaced by 'rollback'
  - New extensions:
    - Bugzilla integration hook
    - Email notification hook
  - Nested repositories are now supported. Mercurial will not recurse
    into a subdirectory that contains a '.hg' directory. It is treated
    as a separate repository.
  - The standalone web server, 'hg serve', is now threaded, so it can
    talk to multiple clients at a time.
  - The web server can now display a "message of the day".
  - Support added for hooks written in Python.
  - Many improvements and clarifications to built-in help.


2006-04-07  v0.8.1

* Major changes from 0.8 to 0.8.1:

  - new extensions:
    mq (manage a queue of patches, like quilt only better)
    email (send changes as series of email patches)
  - new command: merge (replaces "update -m")
  - improved commands: log (--limit option added), pull/push ("-r" works
    on specific revisions), revert (rewritten, much better)
  - comprehensive hook support
  - output templating added, supporting e.g. GNU changelog style
  - Windows, Mac OS X: prebuilt binary packages, better support
  - many reliability, performance, and memory usage improvements


2006-01-29  v0.8 

* Upgrade notes:

  - diff and status command are now repo-wide by default
   (use 'hg diff .' for the old behavior)
  - GPG signing is now done with the gpg extension
  - the --text option for commit, rawcommit, and tag has been removed
  - the copy/rename --parents option has been removed

* Major changes from 0.7 to 0.8:

  - faster status, diff, and commit
  - reduced memory usage for push and pull
  - improved extension API
  - new bisect, gpg, hgk, and win32text extensions
  - short URLs, binary file handling, and optional gitweb skin for hgweb
  - numerous new command options including log --keyword and pull --rev
  - improved hooks and file filtering

 
2005-09-21  v0.7 with modifications

* New INI files have been added to control Mercurial's behaviour:

    System-wide -  C:\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini
    Per-user    -  C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Mercurial.ini

  A default version of the system-wide INI file is installed with
  Mercurial.  No per-user INI file is installed, but it will be
  honoured if you create one.

* Windows line endings are now handled automatically and correctly by
  the update and commit commands.  See the INI file for how to
  customise this behaviour.

* NOTE: Much of the rest of the Mercurial code does not handle Windows
  line endings properly.  Accordingly, the output of the diff command,
  for example, will appear huge until I fix this.

* Packaged text files now have correct Windows line endings.


2005-09-21  v0.7 with modifications

* This is the first standalone release of Mercurial for Windows.

* I believe it to be mostly functional, with one exception: there is
  no support yet for DOS <-> Unix line ending conversion.
